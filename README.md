# -DescriptiveStatistics-

ðŸ“š **Introduction**

- Descriptive statistics is used to summarize large amounts of information, make decisions, answer socially relevant questions, and recognize patterns in data.

ðŸ”‘ **Important Concepts**

- **Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics**: Descriptive statistics is used to summarize the past, while inferential statistics is used to predict future performance.
- **Types of Data**: Data can be categorical (ordinal, nominal) or numerical (discrete, continuous).
- **Measures of Central Tendency**: These include the mean (average), median (middle value), and mode (most frequent value).
- **Measures of Dispersion**: These include range, interquartile range, and standard deviation.
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: This is the mathematical technique that allows us to summarize and describe a set of data. Think of it as the "executive summary" of your data.
2. **Inferential Statistics**: This is where things get interesting. Inferential statistics allows us to make deductions about an entire population based on a sample of it.
3. **Bias in Statistics**: Although statistics can be a powerful tool, it can also be used to distort the truth. It is important to remember that data can be biased and that different statisticians can give different impressions of the same data.
4. **Data Science Workflow**: This is the process we follow in data science, from data ingestion and validation, through model preparation and training, to model evaluation and production.
